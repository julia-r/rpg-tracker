# rpg-tracker

This is a tool for Pen&Paper / Tabletop that will help you keep track of your characters stats, starting with Hitpoints.

This is not supposed to be a character editor, but rather a tool for all the stuff one usually notes while playing, e.g.

* How many hitpoints do I have currently?
* How much money?

This should work for fantasy settings, but should not be depending on system specific rules.
